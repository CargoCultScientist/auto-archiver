# Requirements

Using the Auto Archiver is very simple, but ideally you have some familiarity with using the command line to run programs. ([Command line crash course](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Getting_started/Environment_setup/Command_line)).

### System Requirements

* Auto Archiver works on any Windows, macOS and Linux computer
* If you're using the **local install** method, then you should make sure to have python3.10+ installed

### Storage Requirements

By default, Auto Archiver uses your local computer storage for any downloaded media (videos, images etc.). If you're downloading large files, this may take up a lot of your local computer's space (more than 5GB of space).

If your storage space is limited, then you may want to set up an [alternative storage method](../modules/storage.md) for your media.
