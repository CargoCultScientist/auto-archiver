# Formatter Modules

Formatter modules are used to format the data extracted from a URL into a specific format. Currently the most widely-used formatter is the HTML formatter, which formats the data into an easily viewable HTML page.

```{include} autogen/formatter.md
```

```{toctree}
:depth: 1
:glob:
autogen/formatter/*
```
