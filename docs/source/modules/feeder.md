# Feeder Modules

Feeder modules are used to feed URLs into the `auto-archiver` for processing. Feeders can take these URLs from a variety of sources, such as a file, a database, or the command line.

The default feeder is the command line feeder, which allows you to input URLs directly into the `auto-archiver` from the command line.

```{include} autogen/feeder.md
