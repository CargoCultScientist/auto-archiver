# Storage Modules

Storage modules are used to store the data extracted from a URL in a persistent location. This can be on your local hard disk, or on a remote server (e.g. S3 or Google Drive).

The default is to store the files downloaded (e.g. images, videos) in a local directory.

```{include} autogen/storage.md
```

```{toctree}
:depth: 1
:hidden:
:glob:
autogen/storage/*
```
